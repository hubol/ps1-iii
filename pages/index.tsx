                    <p>
                        iii or the iowa itinerant intranet is a curated local network that is only accessible within
                        immediate range of the iii device.
                    </p>

                    <h2>WHAT DOES THE iii HOLD?</h2>
                    <p>
                        iii functions as an internet, w/o the internet. It is purposefully disconnected, making
                        accessing its information bound to its physical location (wherever that may be).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It can hold games, pdfs, chat, boards, digital artwork, websites, music, movies, guest books,
                        etcâ€¦ basically anything the internet holds (only w/o all the lame password inputting).
                    </p>
